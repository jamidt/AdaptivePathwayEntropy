# Entropy calculation of adaptive pathways

Calculation of the pathway-, endpoint-, and conditional entropy on an
adaptive fitness landscape. The path weight distibution is calculated
according to

Weinreich, Daniel M., et al. "Darwinian evolution can follow only very few mutational paths to fitter proteins." science 312.5770 (2006): 111-114

Be warned, this is only used for generating my numerics and not a
general purpose approach. For smaller landscapes it is better to use the
integer representation of a vertex on the Hamming space.
